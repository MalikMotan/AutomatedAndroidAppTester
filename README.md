# AutomatedAndroidAppTester
Android app parser

Automated testing application for Android apps. This tool checks the Android app activity files for any acquired resources that were not released, and shows a failure message on this application window. Besides, this model-based automated testing application injects TODO comments where the system resources (such as camera) were caught but nor released, to prompt the developer to release these and avoid bugs.
